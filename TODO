sorry for my english :(

	.make 'mem_stack' use uint8_t and not char 
	as it would be easer to work with uint8_t

	.change uint16_t to somthing that can be 
	assigned in the header with typedef

	.check the mem_addrs for errors e.g. wrong end point

	.add a clean / clear function
	
	.get mem_free and mem_used working

	.clean up code and make it look better, also add more comments

	.dump the mem_info to a file

	.give a option to read from the file without dumping it into memory
