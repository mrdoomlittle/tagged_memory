sorry for my english :(

	.make 'mem_stack' use uint8_t and not char 
	as it would be easer to work with uint8_t

	.change uint16_t to somthing that can be 
	assigned in the header with typedef

	.check the mem_addrs for errors e.g. wrong end point

	.add a clean / clear function
	
	.get mem_free and mem_used working

	.clean up code and make it look better, also add more comments

	.dump the mem_info to a file

	.give a option to read from the file without dumping it into memory
	
	.add a extra var to the set_mem_value func this will indicate how
	many times over it will be called, knowing this we will be able to speed things
	up by not needing to cehck the name for a match over and over or the list addr.
